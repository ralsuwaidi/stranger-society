## I write to think

Writing helps me think and pose hard questions which I can mull over and take my time to sort them out. Through my various interest I come across interesting ideas and concepts which I think are worth sharing. Some of the ideas I come across are very obscure and hard to grasp, hence, having a space to think and write would help me break it down. And who knows, someone may find my writings useful.
