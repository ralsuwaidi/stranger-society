The importance of self-determined and self-motivated goals cannot be stressed enough. Goal attainment that fulfill basic needs and are aligned with one's values and passions are related to [greater wellbeing](https://books.google.ae/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DcAe2b7L-RgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&ots=dsyK5JW6Xi&sig=2YfZWnnxNi3CCFDXuZhkB3-utVg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), higher [levels of meaningfulness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15298868.2017.1375003?journalCode=psai20) and lower [symptoms of depression](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672982412006). 

An increasing number of young people experience [mental health problems](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fhea0000773) and there is a lot of interest in the topic of meaning and purpose which shows [promising results](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656607000396?via%3Dihub). People with a purpose in life feel less stressed when making important decisions and are better at regulating their emotions which [improves their mental health](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fhea0000729).

However, searching for meaning [did not help with actually finding meaning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00484.x). Sometimes people who search for meaning are even [less likely to find it](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00484.x) than ones who don't. This means people who are searching for meaning will not be able to find it unless they are prompted to do so; through a psychological intervention. It is shown that doing this early enough in adolescence as part of a school curriculum is [very effective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/yd.430).

Many people drift through life chasing [happiness](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2014.943801), while others live the life of [their parents](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1954-04881-001). Taking the "socially prescribed" perfectionism where people try to live up to the standards of others leads to [burn-out and lack of meaning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917300442?via%3Dihub). Parents and teachers look at what a student is good at rather than what [competencies the student needs](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1375003) to develop to become the person they want to be.

Having a stronger connection with a future self leads to [better grades](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1375003). Having goals that help achieve that future self leads students to make [more progress in their goals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672982412006). This points to the [importance of having people reflect on their goals](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.16790symposium). If people don't formulate their own goals they would [lose contact with their core values and passions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1322530). 

Having goals allow people to have a more [optimistic mindset](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.56.3.218) which helps them acquire skills which in turn improve their [happiness and health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735810000425?via%3Dihub). Having a purpose in life also improved [academic performance](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominique-Morisano/publication/256374704_Morisano_D_2013_Goal_setting_in_the_academic_arena_In_E_A_Locke_G_Latham_Eds_New_Developments_in_Goal_Setting_and_Task_Performance_pp_495-506_NY_Routledge/links/59dd2b7d458515f6efef2900/Morisano-D-2013-Goal-setting-in-the-academic-arena-In-E-A-Locke-G-Latham-Eds-New-Developments-in-Goal-Setting-and-Task-Performance-pp-495-506-NY-Routledge.pdf). 

[Writing down personal goals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167201277003) is very [important in finding purpose](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amd.2018.0187), and writing more than 15 mins has an even [larger effect](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-2909.132.6.823). The goals themselves don't need to be specific as long as the [plans to attain them are](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.16790symposium). Even a small intervention can have a [huge impact](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721413512856) on people's lives, and an intervention such as this is [easily scalable](https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201514#supplementary-information).

Values, Passion, and Personal Goals
-----------------------------------

It can be difficult to make important life decisions, in particular young adults [struggle with such a burden](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SXNgDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&ots=8ZLdkbG-Ml&sig=vUlFoMCaMWsfr26uThk8ps_vdCw) as they move into early adulthood. As long as the goals are linked with specific actions, [it doesn't matter if the goal is broad](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.57.9.705). People without meaning or who have been searching for one and can't find it are often [dissatisfied with themselves](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760802303127). 

Goal setting is one of psychology's [most powerful tool](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HBPUrZ9ov1kC&oi=fnd&pg=PT5&ots=Zni0rT0Sxp&sig=1Hlbv13_g1nDXKM-iifEUW8qpKQ) with the potential to solve major [social problems](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=T.+D.+Wilson&publication_year=2011&journal=Redirect:+The+surprising+new+science+of+psychological+change&). Narrative writing has been shown to help people cope with [life stressors](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.58.3.528). Students who write about their thoughts and feelings about entering college showed [better health outcomes and improved their grades](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.58.3.528). Students' grades [improved](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amd.2018.0187) even if they did not have goals that are directly linked.
