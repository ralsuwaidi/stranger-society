**Introduction**
================

The importance of self-determined and self-motivated goals cannot be stressed enough. Goal attainment that fulfill basic needs and are aligned with one's values and passions are related to [greater wellbeing](https://books.google.ae/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DcAe2b7L-RgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&ots=dsyK5JW6Xi&sig=2YfZWnnxNi3CCFDXuZhkB3-utVg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), higher [levels of meaningfulness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15298868.2017.1375003?journalCode=psai20) and lower [symptoms of depression](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672982412006).

An increasing number of young people experience [mental health problems](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fhea0000773) and there is a lot of interest in the topic of meaning and purpose which shows [promising results](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656607000396?via%3Dihub). People with a purpose in life feel less stressed when making important decisions and are better at regulating their emotions which [improves their mental health](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fhea0000729).

However, searching for meaning [did not help with actually finding meaning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00484.x). Sometimes people who search for meaning are even [less likely to find it](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00484.x) than ones who don't. This means people who are searching for meaning will not be able to find it unless they are prompted to do so; through a psychological intervention. It is shown that doing this early enough in adolescence as part of a school curriculum is [very effective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/yd.430).

Many people drift through life chasing [happiness](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2014.943801), while others live the life of [their parents](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1954-04881-001). Taking the "socially prescribed" perfectionism where people try to live up to the standards of others leads to [burn-out and lack of meaning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917300442?via%3Dihub). Parents and teachers look at what a student is good at rather than what [competencies the student needs](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1375003) to develop to become the person they want to be.

Having a stronger connection with a future self leads to [better grades](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1375003). Having goals that help achieve that future self leads students to make [more progress in their goals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672982412006). This points to the [importance of having people reflect on their goals](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.16790symposium). If people don't formulate their own goals they would [lose contact with their core values and passions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1322530).

Having goals allow people to have a more [optimistic mindset](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.56.3.218) which helps them acquire skills which in turn improve their [happiness and health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735810000425?via%3Dihub). Having a purpose in life also improved [academic performance](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominique-Morisano/publication/256374704_Morisano_D_2013_Goal_setting_in_the_academic_arena_In_E_A_Locke_G_Latham_Eds_New_Developments_in_Goal_Setting_and_Task_Performance_pp_495-506_NY_Routledge/links/59dd2b7d458515f6efef2900/Morisano-D-2013-Goal-setting-in-the-academic-arena-In-E-A-Locke-G-Latham-Eds-New-Developments-in-Goal-Setting-and-Task-Performance-pp-495-506-NY-Routledge.pdf).

[Writing down personal goals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167201277003) is very [important in finding purpose](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amd.2018.0187), and writing more than 15 mins has an even [larger effect](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-2909.132.6.823). The goals themselves don't need to be specific as long as the [plans to attain them are](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.16790symposium). Even a small intervention can have a [huge impact](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721413512856) on people's lives, and an intervention such as this is [easily scalable](https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201514#supplementary-information).

Values, Passion, and Personal Goals
-----------------------------------

It can be difficult to make important life decisions, in particular young adults [struggle with such a burden](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SXNgDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&ots=8ZLdkbG-Ml&sig=vUlFoMCaMWsfr26uThk8ps_vdCw) as they move into early adulthood. As long as the goals are linked with specific actions, [it doesn't matter if the goal is broad](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.57.9.705). People without meaning or who have been searching for one and can't find it are often [dissatisfied with themselves](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760802303127).

Goal setting is one of psychology's [most powerful tool](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HBPUrZ9ov1kC&oi=fnd&pg=PT5&ots=Zni0rT0Sxp&sig=1Hlbv13_g1nDXKM-iifEUW8qpKQ) with the potential to solve major [social problems](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=T.+D.+Wilson&publication_year=2011&journal=Redirect:+The+surprising+new+science+of+psychological+change&). Narrative writing has been shown to help people cope with [life stressors](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.58.3.528). Students who write about their thoughts and feelings about entering college showed [better health outcomes and improved their grades](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.58.3.528). Students' grades [improved](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amd.2018.0187) even if they did not have goals that are directly linked. There are [two types of goals](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.141), one that is more self-serving (hedonistic) and another that is more oriented towards helping others (eudimonic). Both lead to well-being but eudimonic may be [more beneficial](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000178) than a self serving goal. Having a calling and not achieving it is [worse than not having a calling](https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0497), showcasing the importance of following through.

**Elements of Goal Setting**
============================

A goal setting intervention can be split into a few parts. The first part is to find what is important in all areas of life and write down what you find passionate about. The second part is to put those passions into goals and formulate plans and backup-plans to [achieve those goals](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201514#supplementary-information). The goals can be split as such:

| Elements                                    | Task Involved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Values and Passion                          | (1) What they like to do, (2) what kind of relationships they would like to have, both in their private life and their work life, (3) what kind of career they would like to have, and (4) lifestyle choices                                                                    |
| Current and desired competencies and habits | (1) Qualities they admire in others, (2) competencies they have or would like to acquire, and (3) their own habits they like or dislike                                                                                                                                         |
| Present and future social life              | (1) Relationship that energize and de- energize them, (2) kinds of friends and acquaintances that are good for them, (3) kinds of friends and acquaintances they would like to have in the future, and (4) what their ideal family life and broader social life would look like |
| Possible future career (path)               | (1) What is important in a job, (2) what is it they like to do, (3) what kind of colleagues do they want, and (4) whom do they want to meet through their work?                                                                                                                 |
| Ideal versus less ideal future              | Best possible self and future when there are no (self-imposed constraints. Contrast this with "future if no changes are made"                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6. Goal attainment and "if-then" olans      | (1) Formulating, strategizing, and prioritizing goals, (2) identifying and describing ways to overcome obstacles, and (3) monitoring progress toward goals                                                                                                                      |
| Public commitment to goal                   | Public statement. which communicates their goals to the world; communicating goals to friends, co- workers                                                                                                                                                                      |

Discovering Values and Passion
------------------------------

Many choose to do what they like but what's "important" is more helpful in [igniting passion](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.80.1.152). Pursuing something that is important allows people to [find more passion in what they do](https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9/) instead of pursuing something they like. Ideally this passion would [align with values](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DcAe2b7L-RgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&ots=dsyK5K06Wj&sig=peMpOKkUgOG6_lYv2n6-ihzkFBU) they hold dear such as collaboration and honesty.

Future Self: Competencies
-------------------------

Knowing yourself and what habit, competencies you have is an [important step](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1046496414553473) to figuring out how to match your values with your passion. A lot of what [you do is habitual](https://doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican0614-38) which is why it's important to know what habits need to change, although that [doesn't mean they are easy to break](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=W.+Jager&publication_year=2003&title=Breaking+bad+habits:+a+dynamical+perspective+on+habit+formation+and+change&journal=Human+decision+making+and+environmental+perception.+Understanding+and+assisting+human+decision+making+in+real-life+settings.+Liber+Amicorum+for+Charles+Vlek&). Being [aware of the habits](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-011-9217-6) and having an "if-else" plan is a good method to breaking them and [forming new ones](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2005.11.006). Many have habits they would like to change (substance abuse, eating behaviour), however, the effects of good intentions like a new year resolution is [very minimal](https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1972.30.1.123). If your goal aligns with your identity and value, instead of someone else's, then working towards that goal would be related to a [higher effect of well-being](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.80.1.152).

Future Self: Social Life
------------------------

Having a strong social network means you will live [longer and healthier](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=M.+Demir&author=H.+Orthel-Clark&author=M.+%C3%96zdemir&author=S.+%C3%96zdemir&publication_year=2015&title=Friendship+and+happiness+among+young+adults&journal=Friendship+and+happiness&pages=117-135). Although this network doesn't have to be very big since as you grow the [quality becomes more important than the quantity](https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000014). The [quality of the network is related to well-being](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-018-1597-8) as well as helpful during the transition to college.

Future Self: Career
-------------------

Work is an important aspect of life. It is important to find a job that suits your passion and from which you can [get energy from](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.03.002). You can actually enhance personal meaning of your work and make it more enjoyable by [changing tasks and relationships with others](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2001.4378011) at work, i.e. the way you think about work. It is not always the job itself but the [meaning you ascribe to the work](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726719848809). It is also good to know how to manage your energy but choosing [when and where to do your daily tasks](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00505) (if you can).

You should also see work in comparison to other areas in life. [Some find themselves](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=C.+M.+Christensen&publication_year=2010&title=How+will+you+measure+your+life&journal=Harv.+Bus.+Rev.&volume=88&pages=46-51) working 70 hours a week who end up divorced and estranged from their children. [No one chooses](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=C.+M.+Christensen&publication_year=2010&title=How+will+you+measure+your+life&journal=Harv.+Bus.+Rev.&volume=88&pages=46-51) this lifestyle deliberately, so it is important to think about goals in your career and outside that too. On top of thinking about [where and when to put your energy](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=C.+M.+Christensen&publication_year=2017&journal=How+will+you+measure+your+life?+(Harvard+business+review+classics)&), you need to think about what kind of people you would like to be working with.

Sometimes you don't have a choice with what career you have. If that's the case make sure you fill your [leisure time with a lot of meaningful activity](https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0497). Crafting meaning in your leisure time can make up the lack thereof in your career to a certain extent.

Future Self: If You Don't Take Action
-------------------------------------

It is important to think about a future that is [attractive to you](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=G.+Oettingen&author=A.+T.+Sevincer&author=P.+M.+Gollwitzer&publication_year=2018&journal=The+psychology+of+thinking+about+the+future&). It is also important to think about how to achieve that future and [compare that with not achieving your desired future](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=G.+Oettingen&author=P.+M.+Gollwitzer&publication_year=2010&title=Strategies+of+setting+and+implementing+goals:+mental+contrasting+and+implementation+intentions&journal=Social+psychological+foundations+of+clinical+psychology&pages=114-135). Doing something like this and imagining the best possible future has a great effect on well-being, even [better than gratitude letters](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760500510676). Writing about three domains -personal, relational, and professional- would make you [more optimistic](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2016.1221122). An even better approach is to write about your [best possible future self](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005791611000358?via%3Dihub). If you use this increased optimism and turn it to concrete plans there's a higher chance that the envisioned future [would become a reality](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201514#supplementary-information).

It is important that you make you write the goals that are important to you, not another one given to you by a parent or society. You should also think hard about goals that you have which are solely for reasons of status. Doing so would endanger you to live someone else's life. It is also worth considering goals that will not affect others in your community negatively. 

Additionally it is important to think about the life you could have if you do not follow up on your goals. This way of framing your goals makes it [more likely to take action](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7455683). Think about the future and imagine what it could be like [if you take action vs if you don't](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=G.+Oettingen&author=P.+M.+Gollwitzer&publication_year=2010&title=Strategies+of+setting+and+implementing+goals:+mental+contrasting+and+implementation+intentions&journal=Social+psychological+foundations+of+clinical+psychology&pages=114-135). If you think about a positive, neutral and negative future, it looks like the positive future [increases happiness significantly](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760902992365). Interesting enough, thinking about a neutral future [reduces current stress](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760902992365).

Goal Attainment Plans
---------------------

After gathering your thoughts and writing down your goals, it is important to formulate concrete plans on how to achieve that goal. Also it is important to combine your personal goals with an [if-then plan](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.231). Also having goals can be daunting and the rewards for achieving them is usually far off in the future. Hence, it is beneficial to identify [small steps](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.110.3.403) to achieving that goal. After spending time discovering your passion and finding goals that align with them, it is important to formulate concrete plans and identify obstacles (if-then plan). Having a desired future would make it easier to identify and be [less engaged](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=W.+Mischel&publication_year=1996&title=From+good+intentions+to+willpower&journal=The+psychology+of+action:+Linking+cognition+and+motivation+to+behavior+(Vol.+197%E2%80%93218)&) with activities that are more distracting than useful.

It is useful to identify both the goal and the obstacle as well as ways to [overcome each obstacle](https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000322). The idea is to describe career as well as social goals (usually about [six to eight](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0018478)) and write down detailed plans to achieve the goals. It is also important to think about the plan as detailed as possible, i.e, how long will you spend each [week and each day](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201514#supplementary-information) working on the golas, what would you do when such and such an obstacle pops up, how would you tune your goal and re-adjust when that needs to happen.
