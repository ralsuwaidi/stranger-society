## What is Stranger Society? 

It’s a journey of introspection, embracing one of the oldest spirits in making sense of the world, internal and external, and communicating it with fellow beings; The spirit of storytelling.

It’s a community for those who choose, willingly, to embrace the stranger’s voice that’s within all of us. 

The voice that questions and shakes the whole foundation of our existence, beliefs and faith. 

The voice that intensifies in our solitude, feeding on our depression, anger and pain. 

The voice that knows nothing but the truth; Our truth. Never failing to remind us about it the moment we choose to ‘forget’. 

Yet within this stranger’s voice, lies all mystery of our human existence. 

The answer to our seeking and a meaning to it all.

Lies not within this voice ‘the man that you could be’. 

But the ‘stranger that you ought to be’; 

To make such a cruel world, a little less so.
