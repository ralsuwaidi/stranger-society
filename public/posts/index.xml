      <description>Introduction The importance of self-determined and self-motivated goals cannot be stressed enough. Goal attainment that fulfill basic needs and are aligned with one&amp;rsquo;s values and passions are related to greater wellbeing, higher levels of meaningfulness and lower symptoms of depression.
An increasing number of young people experience mental health problems and there is a lot of interest in the topic of meaning and purpose which shows promising results. People with a purpose in life feel less stressed when making important decisions and are better at regulating their emotions which improves their mental health.</description>
