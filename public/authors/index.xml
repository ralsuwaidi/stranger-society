      <description>I write to think Writing helps me think and pose hard questions which I can mull over and take my time to sort them out. Through my various interest I come across interesting ideas and concepts which I think are worth sharing. Some of the ideas I come across are very obscure and hard to grasp, hence, having a space to think and write would help me break it down. And who knows, someone may find my writings useful.</description>

      <description>What is Stranger Society? It’s a journey of introspection, embracing one of the oldest spirits in making sense of the world, internal and external, and communicating it with fellow beings; The spirit of storytelling.
It’s a community for those who choose, willingly, to embrace the stranger’s voice that’s within all of us.
The voice that questions and shakes the whole foundation of our existence, beliefs and faith.
The voice that intensifies in our solitude, feeding on our depression, anger and pain.</description>
